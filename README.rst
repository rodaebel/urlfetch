Asynchronous URL Fetch Service
==============================

This project aims at providing a URL Fetch Service for web application
developers to make concurrent asynchronous HTTP requests. The service is
entirely written in Erlang and so, it leverages the robust and scalable
Erlang/OTP platform.
